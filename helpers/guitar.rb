# Guitar Strumming - by Emlyn
# This tries to work out the guitar (or ukulele etc.) fingering for arbitrary chords (and tuning).
# It seems to work reasonably well for basic chords, but is quite naive and probably makes many mistakes.
# Ideas, bug reports, fixes etc. gratefully received, just comment below, or tweet @emlyn77.
# Feel free to make use of this code as you like (with attribution if you feel like it, but you don't have to).
# Thanks to @Project_Hell_CK for fixing the tuning, and spotting that it gets chord(:f, :major) not quite right.

# Return ring representing the chord chrd, as played on a guitar with given tuning
